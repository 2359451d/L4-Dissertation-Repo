	abstract = {Register allocation is a critical part of any compiler, yet register allocation for stack machines has received relatively little attention in the past. We present a framework for the analysis of register allocation methods for stack machines which has allowed us to analyse current methods. We have used this framework to design the ﬁrst truly procedure-wide register allocation methods for stack machines. We have designed two such methods, both of which outperform current techniques.},
